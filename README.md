## Introduction

**GenomeAssembly** is a bioinformatics pipeline that performs de novo genome assembly on long read data. A fastq file and input information is fed to the pipeline, resulting in a final assembly with quality checking at each step. [detailed output]

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

Short Read Assembly (optional)
1. Read QC, Contaminant Filtering, Adaptor Trimming([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/),[`GenomeScope`](http://qb.cshl.edu/genomescope/),[`Jellyfish`](https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish),[`Kraken2`](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/), [`Recentrifuge`](https://github.com/khyox/recentrifuge),[`FastP`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp))
2. Align([`BWA`](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml))
3. Polish([`POLCA`](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007981))
Hybrid assembly is conducted within the long read assembly subworkflow, and downstream quality checking is also conducted in the long read QC subworkflows.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your long read input data that looks as follows:

`longread_samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,single_end
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq,,TRUE
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

If short reads are available, prepare a second samplesheet with your short read input data that looks as follows:

`shortread_samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,single_end
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq,FALSE
```

Next, create a params.yaml file to specify the paths to your samplesheet(s), contaminant databases, etc. Most likely, a config file will also need to be made to modify the default settings of the pipeline. Please look through the [nextflow.config](nextflow.config) file to browse the defaults and specify which you would like to change in you my_config file. More information is located in the [usage](docs/usage.md) section.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:


```bash
nextflow run emilytrybulec/genomeassembly \
  -r main \
  -params-file params.yaml \
  -c my_config \
  -profile singularity,xanadu \
```

> **Warning:**
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
> provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
